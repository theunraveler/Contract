Hi! I'm excited to be doing business together! I'm a good developer; my work is
professional, my rates are reasonable, and my demeanor is friendly. I am
certain you will be a good client as well.

I can read and write a couple different languages, and legalese is not one of
them. I'm sure you are in the same boat. And lawyers are really expensive. So
my purpose behind writing this contract is so that you, the client, and I, the
developer, can communicate our expectations and requirements in plain language,
so that we're crystal clear about who gets and does what when.

It's a bit like the "sign it in blood" sentiment only&mdash;yeah, put the knife
down&mdash;ink will do just fine.
