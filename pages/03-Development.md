2. Development
==============

This is the fun part.

2.01 Terms of Development
-------------------------

1. I only work on code that is under version control. I have no preference
   regarding what system you use for version control, but there must be one. If
   there is not, I will set up a Git repository for you and bill you for the
   2 hours it will take.
2. I will not do work on your servers. This is sort of a no-brainer; if
   a client stiffs me on payment, and I did all of my work on their servers,
   they now have all of my work, and I have none of my money. That's bad. So,
   I will work locally and deploy to a copy of your site on my server for
   review, then push code to your server only after we have settled up on
   payment.
3. I will provide test links to preview functionality based on a schedule that
   we establish at the start of the project. Typically, "iterations" will be
   one to two weeks long, and updates and test links will be given at the end
   of each iteration.
4. All work will be built and approved based on the scope we agree upon.

2.02 The Code
-------------

1. I really prefer test-driven development, and you should too. While it can
   add a bit of cost in the short term, it really pays off as your site grows
   and you begin doing maintenance on it. Having properly-tested code basically
   guarantees that if a change breaks your site, you will know before your
   customers/clients/users. Testing is always money well spent. We will discuss
   whether I will be writing tests for my code at the start of the project.
